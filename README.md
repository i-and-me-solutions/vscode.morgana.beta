# Morgana - Revolutionizing RPG Development ðŸš€

Welcome to **Morgana**, the brainchild of a passionate startup team on a mission to transform RPG development! We believe that even the most legacy-driven codebases deserve modern, intuitive tools. Thatâ€™s why we created Morgana. A Visual Studio Code extension that reimagines how developers interact with RPG code. Whether youâ€™re maintaining decades-old fixed-format RPG or dreaming of a free-format future, Morgana is here to make your life easier, your workflow faster, and your projects more fun.

## Why Morgana?

Letâ€™s face it: RPG development can feel stuck in the past. But it doesnâ€™t have to be! Morgana is here to:

- **Simplify Your Workflow**: With a structured outline view, youâ€™ll never get lost in your RPGLE and SQLRPGLE files again.
- **Focus on Fixed-Format (For Now)**: Weâ€™re starting with fixed-format RPG, but weâ€™re already building the tools to support mixed-format and free-format RPG. The future is bright, and itâ€™s on our roadmap!
- **Boost Your Productivity**: Jump to definitions, navigate large programs, and resolve file issues in record time.
- **Integrate Seamlessly**: Morgana works hand-in-hand with the [Code for IBM i](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HalcyonTechLtd.code-for-ibmi) extension, so you can focus on coding, not configuring.

## Our Vision ðŸŒŸ

Weâ€™re not just building a tool; weâ€™re building a movement. RPG developers deserve modern, powerful tools that make their work exciting and impactful. Morgana is just the beginning. Together, we can:

- Bring RPG development into the 21st century.
- Empower developers to tackle legacy code with confidence.
- Create a community of innovators who love RPG as much as we do.

## Whatâ€™s Next? ðŸ”®

Weâ€™re just getting started. Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s on the horizon:

- **Mixed-Format and Free-Format Support**: Weâ€™re working hard to bring you the tools you need for modern RPG development.
- **Blazing-Fast Performance**: Because no one likes waiting.
- **Global Reach**: Localization for developers around the world.
- **Community-Driven Features**: Your ideas, your tools. Letâ€™s build this together.
