# Morgana - Modernizing RPG Development

Welcome to **Morgana**, a project by a dedicated team aiming to bring RPG development tools into the modern era. RPG development has long been tied to legacy workflows, and we believe it‚Äôs time for a change. Morgana is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to make working with RPG code more intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable. Whether you‚Äôre maintaining fixed-format RPG or preparing for mixed and free-format RPG, Morgana is here to support you every step of the way.

## üåü Why Morgana?

RPG development doesn‚Äôt have to be stuck in the past. Morgana is here to:

- **Simplify Your Workflow**: With a structured outline view, you‚Äôll always have a clear overview of your RPGLE and SQLRPGLE files.
- **Focus on Fixed-Format (For Now)**: Our current focus is on fixed-format RPG, but we‚Äôre actively working on adding support for mixed-format and free-format RPG. These enhancements are part of our roadmap.
- **Boost Your Productivity**: Quickly navigate large programs, jump to definitions, and resolve file issues with ease.
- **Integrate Seamlessly**: Morgana works alongside the [Code for IBM i](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HalcyonTechLtd.code-for-ibmi) extension, ensuring a smooth development experience.

## üìù What is MORGANA Outline?

MORGANA Outline is an (RPG) Outline for Visual Studio Code that looks very similar to the one you already know from other IBM i editors but with significantly expanded functionality.

## ‚ùì Why not use the VS Code Outline?

The VS Code outline was developed for all possible programming languages, but as we all know, column-oriented or fixed-format RPG is unique in the programming world. Also, old RPG programs were often not developed modularly, while the features included in VS Code are strongly geared towards modular development. This means that the functionality integrated into VS Code is also suitable for very modern, totally free RPGs that are modularized.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How does MORGANA Outline work?

Unlike other tools that support an RPG outline function, MORGANA Outline retrieves all information directly from the source code. To do this, the source code is first divided into so-called tokens using a special parser. We originally developed this functionality purely for our AI-based analysis tools, but then realized that it could be used wonderfully as an outline in VS Code. In addition to the pure source code that is open, Morgana also accesses sources used in RPG, such as display files, printer files, database files as well as Subprocedures in Modules/Service Programs or CALLs.

## üìÇ Which languages / source types does Beta 1 support?

MORGANA Outline was originally developed specifically for older and more complex RPG applications and, in Beta 1, exclusively supports column RPG in ILE format (RPG IV). Since the IBM command CVTRPGSRC makes it very easy to convert RPG-III and RPG/400 source code into ILE code, we always take this approach with our customers and do not intend to support RPG-III or RPG/400 directly unless there is demand for it. We also convert RPG-II and OCL source code into ILE RPG internally using a special tool. If you are interested in this, please contact us.

## üîÆ Which languages / source types will be supported next?

In the next step, we will support ILE-based Hybrid RPG and Free RPG. In addition, embedded SQL in RPG will be supported for the above variants. This will be followed by CL / CLLE. Cobol and ILE Cobol developers, please contact us.

## üöÄ Which Features does Beta 1 provide?

Beta 1 supports:

- **Field Recognition**: Identify where a field is defined, used, and modified, including fields defined within the C specification.
- **Screen File Record Formats**: Recognize record formats in screen files, including fields defined therein and their usage. Directly open the source code with a simple mouse click.
- **Print File Record Formats**: Recognize record formats in print files, including fields defined therein and their usage. Directly open the source code with a simple mouse click.
- **Database File Record Formats**: Recognize record formats in database files, including fields defined therein and their usage. Directly open the source code with a simple mouse click.
- **Data Structures**: Recognize data structures and their subfields, including their usage.
- **Arrays**: Recognize arrays and their usage.
- **Subroutines**: Recognize subroutines and their usage.
- **Subprocedures**: Recognize subprocedures and their usage.
- **Indicators**: Recognize indicators and their usage. MORGANA also recognizes MOVEA changes to *IN()!
- **Key Lists (KLIST)**: Recognize key lists, including the fields used therein.
- **Parameter Lists (PLIST)**: Recognize parameter lists, including the fields used therein.
- **Subprocedure Navigation**: Directly open the source code of a subprocedure with a simple mouse click based on the library list and binding directories.
- **Program Calls**: Recognize CALLs to programs and directly open the source code of a called program with a simple mouse click.
- **Goto Marker Function**: Highlight TAGs and GOTOs to specific TAGs in the same color in the MORGANA Outline header. This function helps when scrolling through code extensively. For specific GOTOs to a TAG, you can also use the Outline function itself.

## üåü Our Vision

Our goal is to provide RPG developers with modern tools that make their work more efficient and enjoyable. With Morgana, we aim to:

- Make RPG development accessible and intuitive for both legacy and modern codebases.
- Empower developers to confidently work with RPG code.
- Build a community of RPG enthusiasts who share ideas and collaborate on improving the development experience.

## üîß What‚Äôs Next?

We‚Äôre committed to continuous improvement. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs on our roadmap:

- **Mixed-Format and Free-Format Support**: Expanding Morgana‚Äôs capabilities to handle modern RPG code styles.
- **Blazing-Fast Performance**: Optimizing the extension for large projects.
- **Global Reach**: Adding localization to support developers worldwide.
- **Community-Driven Features**: Incorporating feedback and ideas from our users.
