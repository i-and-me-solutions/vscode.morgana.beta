# Morgana - Modernizing RPG Development

Welcome to **Morgana**, a project by a dedicated team aiming to bring RPG development tools into the modern era. RPG development has long been tied to legacy workflows, and we believe itâ€™s time for a change. Morgana is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to make working with RPG code more intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable. Whether youâ€™re maintaining fixed-format RPG or preparing for mixed and free-format RPG, Morgana is here to support you every step of the way.

## Why Morgana?

RPG development doesnâ€™t have to be stuck in the past. Morgana is here to:

- **Simplify Your Workflow**: With a structured outline view, youâ€™ll always have a clear overview of your RPGLE and SQLRPGLE files.
- **Focus on Fixed-Format (For Now)**: Our current focus is on fixed-format RPG, but weâ€™re actively working on adding support for mixed-format and free-format RPG. These enhancements are part of our roadmap.
- **Boost Your Productivity**: Quickly navigate large programs, jump to definitions, and resolve file issues with ease.
- **Integrate Seamlessly**: Morgana works alongside the [Code for IBM i](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HalcyonTechLtd.code-for-ibmi) extension, ensuring a smooth development experience.

## Our Vision ðŸŒŸ

Our goal is to provide RPG developers with modern tools that make their work more efficient and enjoyable. With Morgana, we aim to:

- Make RPG development accessible and intuitive for both legacy and modern codebases.
- Empower developers to confidently work with RPG code.
- Build a community of RPG enthusiasts who share ideas and collaborate on improving the development experience.

## Whatâ€™s Next? ðŸ”®

Weâ€™re committed to continuous improvement. Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s on our roadmap:

- **Mixed-Format and Free-Format Support**: Expanding Morganaâ€™s capabilities to handle modern RPG code styles.
