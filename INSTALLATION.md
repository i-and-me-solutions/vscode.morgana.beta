# Installing the Morgana Beta Extension

The Morgana Extension consists of two components:

* **Morgana VS Code Extension** - The main extension that runs in Visual Studio Code
* **Morgana Backend** - A server component that runs on IBM i

While you can use the VS Code extension independently, some features (such as opening referenced files) require the Morgana Backend to be installed on your IBM i system for full functionality.

## Install VS Code Extension via VSIX file

To install the Morgana Beta extension in Visual Studio Code using a VSIX file, follow these steps:

1. **Get the VSIX File**
    - Contact us at [morgana@iandme.rocks](mailto:morgana@iandme.rocks) to request access to the VSIX file. We'll provide you with the download link or send the file directly.

2. **Open Visual Studio Code**
   - Launch Visual Studio Code on your computer.

3. **Access the Extensions View**
   - Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the VS Code window. Alternatively, you can open the Extensions view by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (macOS).

4. **Install from VSIX**
   - Click on the `...` (More Actions) button in the top-right corner of the Extensions view.
   - Select `Install from VSIX...` from the dropdown menu.

5. **Locate the VSIX File**
   - In the file dialog that appears, navigate to the location where you saved the VSIX file.
   - Select the VSIX file and click `Open`.

6. **Wait for Installation**
   - VS Code will install the extension. Once the installation is complete, you will see a confirmation message.

7. **Reload VS Code (if required)**
   - Some extensions may require you to reload VS Code to activate them. If prompted, click the `Reload` button.

Your Morgana Beta extension is now installed and ready to use.
